## Naming Conventions

### Types

Elementary types are denoted by single capital letters 
as follows: `N` unsigned integer, `C` character, `S` sequence, 
`E` execution token, `A` address, `Q` quotation. 
These are mandatory. Further elementary types are `I` for signed 
integers, `X` for single precision floating point numbers, `V` for
vectors.

Composite types are denoted by `CamelCase` descriptive names.

### Postfix Functions and Effects

These are denoted by all-lowercase descriptive names.
