# How To Come Up With a Really Good Type System?

## Why Not Do Stuff The Obviously Right Way?

Rejecting the obvious choice between

1. First becoming an expert by going through a graduate-level textbook 
(or more) doing all exercises etc. and then setting out to do the task,

2. Adopting an existing type system without any changes

is motivated by the very objective of maintaining focus on the 
[forward-looking perspective](../ROCKS_AND_STICKS.md), i.e. requring the 
minimal amount of resources for the maximal increment in technical 
sophistication at every step of the way. If one starts out with the 
bells and whistles of what is the state-of-the-art, the chances of not 
using much more than absolutely necessary are very slim.

But is there any other way? Surely, reinventing the wheel (badly) won't 
get us far.

## Learn By Doing, Do By Learning

There are already charted paths from here (being a person willing to learn) 
to there (being an expert): graduate-level textbooks and online courses. 
In addition to being a guide on which steps to take in what order, they 
provide one more crucial piece of information: how far are we along the way?

In other words, one reasonably good metric of complexity is how far into 
the course/textbook are the things needed for accomplishing a particular task 
or reaching a particular milestone. We should strive to minimize on this 
metric. E.g. as we get to, say, Chapter 4, when we are deciding what features 
to include in the next milestone, we should prefer those in Chapter 2 to 
those in Chapter 3 and pretty much avoid those in Chapter 4. If it cannot 
be done that way to our satisfaction, we move on to Chapter 5 and repeat 
the exercise. Hopefully, understanding Chapter 5 will help us to completely 
avoid things even from Chapter 3. ;-)

Standing on the shoulders of giants is important, but keep looking forward 
to see far.

## Which Book/Course to Use?

Especially in the very beginning, it might be a good idea to use more than 
one, as insurance against arbitrary biases of any one author. So the 
first step along the way of coming up with a really good type system is
finding a few courses/textbooks on the topic and selecting at least two 
by which to start learning.
