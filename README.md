# Seedling

A Programming Language for Everyone and Everything

This repository is *not* just for the source code of the seedling language 
and at present you won't even find it here, because it has not been written yet.

The repo contains a *plan* of writing seedling and that plan is also subject to 
versioned changes, issue tracking and careful debugging. We are programming people 
(ourselves) here. Much like climbing a mountain or flying a difficult route, an 
endeavor of this magnitude and risk of failure requires reasonably short, but very 
careful pre-execution planning and an explicit plan available during execution.

The goal of this project is the specification and a self-hosting reference implementation 
of a foundational programming language sufficiently flexible and extensible to be 
ultimately suitable for the widest possible range of programming tasks from the lowest 
to the highest level.

Please read [the rationale](RATIONALE.md) before proceeding.
