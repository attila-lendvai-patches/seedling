A Programming Language for Everyone and Everything

## Motivation

It is a very sorry state of affairs that we use completely unrelated, different and often quite incompatible programming languages for
 * teaching programming,
 * interacting with the command line and scripting the shell,
 * solving numerical problems of high complexity,
 * programming microcontrollers and device drivers,
 * marking up (or down) hypertext,
 * writing interpreters and compilers,
 * writing macros for, well, anything,
 * assembling machine code with full control over each bit,
 * describing the build process of a complex piece of software,
 * drafting smart contracts for decentralized applications,
 * transacting with these smart contracts,
 * synthesizing or annotating nucleotide sequences,
 * cooking gourmet dishes,
 * choreographing stage performances.

The only thing worse than solving all these different programming tasks in different programming languages is using the *wrong* language for a particular task. Every now and then you meet programmers enamored with some programming language that advocate for using *their* favorite language for everything, but with one notable exception they usually don't succeed in convincing the rest of the world and for very good reasons. Not for a long time, anyway; sometimes programming languages become fashionable for a short while, but as soon as their limitations become apparent and the coolness factor wears off, they either go entirely out of fashion or, in the best case, carve out a niche for tasks for which they are particularly well suited. With one notable exception: **C**.
